### Hi there 👋

My name is **Celso Wellington** and I create applications using **TypeScript**.
Currently I've got more experience with front-end applications, also exploring mobile development using React Native. I'm passionate about open source culture & knowledge and looking forward to contribute more with the development community. I do most of my learning by conducting my own research, sometimes I use some courses and tutorials to kickstart something, but I learn best by studying existing applications, examples and documentation (for possibilities), and I do it for professional purposes since **july/2019**.
