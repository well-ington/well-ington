### Hi there 👋

I'm a curious person who loves to create cool stuff using web and mobile technologies 😁 


In the client-side, I work with: vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, Preact, Leaflet, Web Workers, Web Storage, Bubble.io, PDFs (generation and data extraction), Text editors (parsing bbcode/html)

For the server-side, I work with: Node serverless

I've already implemented the services:
Twilio API, HERE routing API

As for mobile development, I work with: Jasonelle and Java


For my personal projects, I love to use in the client-side:
React, TypeScript, Jest, React Testing Library, webpack, babel, Redux, SCSS and even ThreeJS

For the server-side:
NodeJS, express, TypeScript

Mobile development:
React Native (android)


## About me

### Development

What to say about me? While I only learned my first programming language at 2009 — it was 'C' and I was at the mechatronics technician course — I was already messing around with web technologies (HTML, CSS and Flash) to help some friends who was either building games or hosting websites.

Years later, I've decided to try to learn some code: first I've build some crappy 2D games using Unity and C#, but that wasn't enought. I went from Unity to Python because I was curious about machine learning, where I've build some simple categorization models (working with numbers, texts and images) and even tried some advanced model, such as GAN (generative adversarial networks) to generate cool images from a Breaking Bad dataset (was trying to merge Jesse Pinkman with Walter White, haha) and even created some LSTM models to try generate tweets and poetry (failed due to poor dataset, but still generated some cool samples). 

From Python I went to JavaScript because I wanted to display the crappy — but cool — stuff I was doing with Python. The problem is: I've got distracted and ended up doing other cool stuff with React and Node 😁 such as ***Voraz***, for example, that was a full-stack project where I've scrapped ifood and aiqfome websites in order to create a database containing all the restaurants in my region that used their services. When the database was created, I've served the data using Express, while consuming the information in a React client using Leaflet.
