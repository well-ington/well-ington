### Hi there 👋

My name is **Celso Wellington**, **TypeScript Developer**, and my current task is to build my portfolio with the kind of technology I want to work 😁 
Currently building an *iFood* clone 🍟 using **TypeScript** with **React Native** and **Android Studio**. After the clone is completed, I'll create an alternate version with a whole new experience 😀
**React** is present in my projects with **TypeScript** since **september/19** 🚀 I've done some personal projects to evolve my skills regarding web-scrapping, data filtering, API interface and data visualization with geolocation using **Leaflet**.

My current learning React Native and mobile development, alongside with code architeture and unit testing (gaining XP). I'm also trying to improve my SOLID principles to diminish the code entropy problem.

### About me
I do love reading books and articles 📰, strategic and competitive games 🎮, cook/bake awesome food 🥐, music 🎶 and international cuisine 🍣.
